# Gegography
Gegography is a library for reading, manipulating and converting
geographical formats, written i pure Go. Currently, support is limited to
GeoJSON and WKT (Well Known Text) but I plan on implementing shapefile and
WKB (Well Known Binary) as well.

Gegography supports the following geographical types:
* Point
* LineString
* Polygon
* MultiPoint
* MultiLineString
* MultiPoint

## Installing
